Binary:

Go to http://www.slitechat.org/download to get the latest binary build.
Currently supported is Microsoft Windows XP+ 32 bit, Mac OS/X i386,
GNU/Linux.

Source:

Go to http://www.slitechat.org/download to obtain the latest version. There is
a zip file for Windows and a tar.gz for Mac/Linux. Optional: you may also
download the 3rdParty tarball/zip file if you want to build in "STANDALONE"
mode.

To build from source, cmake version 2.6 is required. You can get this from
http://www.cmake.org/ .

For GNU/Linux and Mac OS/X, you will need to fetch the boost 1.34+ (I recommend
getting the latest version of boost, 1.38) libary (http://www.boost.org) and the
latest Qt4 distribution (http://www.qtsoftware.com/).  Under Ubuntu, for
example, you can just install the boost dev packages and the Qt4 dev packages.

Download the SLiteChat tarball and unpack it. If you wish to build link against
the 3rdParty tarball, then unpack it into a sister directory. Create a BUILD
folder in your SLiteChat and change directories there. Run the cmake command as
follows:

For non-standalone mode, do the following:

$ cd slitechat
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ cmake -DTHIRDPARTY_DIR:PATH=/home/fred/src/3rdParty ..
$ make
$ make install

If you prefer a pleasant GUI experience, may I recommend cmake-gui? This
presents a list of required and optional switches that the build supports. I
tried to document them so they make sense, but YMMV. :-)

In order to build standalone, you would turn on the STANDALONE:BOOL switch and
not bother specifying the 3rdParty folder since it is not needed. For
standalone mode you will need to make sure you have the following development
packages installed:

	Apr-1 and Apr-util-1, Boost, CARes, CURL, expat, OpenSSL, Qt4, libsigc++,
	XmlRpcEPI, and zlib.

For Microsoft Windows using Visual Studio 8, you can generate sln and vcproj
files using cmake, then build using the IDE. You can also generated nmake
files, but I have not tested if this builds correctly.
