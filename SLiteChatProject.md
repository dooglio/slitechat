# Introduction #
SLiteChat (pronounced "slight-chat") is a text-only view for Second Life which is focused on in-world IM support.
What it is:

SLiteChat is a lightweight client which allows you to connect to the Second Life system and perform local chat and instant messaging with avatars in-world.
What it is not:

SLiteChat is not intended to be a fully-functional in-world viewer for Second Life.

Why another text-only client? Well, for one, this is something I've been wanting to do since I first got into Second Life. One of the issues was not having to invoke the fat client (viewer) with all the wiz-bang OpenGL stuff just to make a simple IM to my friends in-world. Secondly, I love open source software, and this is my way of giving back. Thirdly, I want to understand the SL codebase and this was a great way to accomplish that!
