SLiteChat (pronounced "slight-chat") is a completely open source text-only IM/chat client for use with Second Life. Use it to talk to your friends without having to load up all of those heavy graphic goodies. Useful for those at-work times!

SLiteChat is a text-only view for Second Life which is focused on in-world IM support.

What it is:

SLiteChat is a lightweight client which allows you to connect to the Second Life system and perform local chat and instant messaging with avatars in-world.

What it is not:

SLiteChat is not intended to be a fully-functional in-world viewer for Second Life. If you are looking for that, check out instead the [Second Life Third Party Viewer Directory](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Third_Party_Viewer_Directory) or the [Second Life Wiki](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Alternate_viewers).
